My name is Roisin White. 
I am graduating in August 2019 with my PhD in [**Human Development and Family Studies**] (https://hhd.psu.edu/hdfs/human-development-and-family-studies-graduate-program) from The Pennsylvania State University. My research has focused on the analysis of large-scale longitudinal datasets as well as neurological experimental data to identify predictors and moderators of psychopathological outcomes in children and adolescents.

Throughout my graduate training, I gained extensive experience in experimental design, project management, and report writing for both scientific and lay audiences. I also attained advanced proficiency in the R programming language for data manipulation, visualization and statistical analysis. An example of some of my work using R can be found on PSU's Quantitative Developmental Systems Methodology Core [**(Quant Dev) website**](https://quantdev.ssri.psu.edu/tutorials/k-nearest-neighbors-introductory-example).
