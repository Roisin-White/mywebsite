      <description>My name is Roisin White. I am graduating in August 2019 with my PhD in Human Development and Family Studies from The Pennsylvania State University. My research has focused on the analysis of large-scale longitudinal datasets as well as neurological experimental data to identify predictors and moderators of psychopathological outcomes in children and adolescents.
Throughout my graduate training, I gained extensive experience in experimental design, project management, and report writing for both scientific and lay audiences.</description>
